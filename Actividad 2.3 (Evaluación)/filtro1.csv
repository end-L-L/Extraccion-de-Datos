ho sempre viaggiato tanto per lavoro e per piacere e mi piace conoscere persone di tutte le nazionalità. 

Quando prenoto alberghi o case apprezzo il servizio, la pulizia, l’eleganza , il confort e la disponibilità degli host. Per questo ho deciso insieme a mio marito Gabriele di creare per voi l’appartamento che vorrei trovare in ogni città.

Ho scelto di vivere a Firenze perché la trovo la città più bella . Soprattuto i quartieri San Frediano e Santo Spirito ritraggono una Firenze antica , caratteristica, ma piena di vita. 

Lonely Planet ha definito San Frediano il quartiere più Cool del mondo addirittura ""meglio di Dubai e New York""
