La mia più grande passione é la mia famiglia, i miei animali e viaggiare oltre all’arte ed alla cucina tradizionale italiana.
La parte che preferisco, a pochi passi dell’appartamento, che riesce ad emozionarmi sempre ogni volta è la chiesa di Santo Spirito con la sua piazza antistante ricca di locali e genuinità fiorentina.
Non potete andare via da Firenze senza aver assaggiato il mio panino preferito da Simone il trippaio di San Frediano in piazza dei Nerli.
Buona visita e divertitevi nella culla della cultura italiana!!

Hi, I’m Anna. I was born in Florence and I love my city, especially the area of Oltrarno since I believe that it is the most authentic and true part of Florence, which has still remained such. I’d like you, my guests, to be able to have wonderful experience in my cozy nest, discovering the beauty of this place which is rich in history and in exciting poetic corners. My biggest passions are my family, my animals and traveling, in addition to art and traditional Italian cuisine. My favourite part of the city, located a stone’s throw from the apartment, is Santo Spirito Church, which always manages to thrill me thanks to the square in front of it. The latter is full of cafes, bars and Florentine genuineness. You can't leave Florence without having tasted my favourite sandwich by Simone, the tripe place from San Frediano in piazza dei Nerli. Have a nice trip and have fun in the cradle of Italian culture!!

Hi, I’m Anna. I was born in Florence and I love my city, especially the area of Oltrarno since I believe that it is the most authentic and true part of Florence, which has still remained such. I’d like you, my guests, to be able to have wonderful experience in my cozy nest, discovering the beauty of this place which is rich in history and in exciting poetic corners. My biggest passions are my family, my animals and traveling, in addition to art and traditional Italian cuisine. My favourite part of the city, located a stone’s throw from the apartment, is Santo Spirito Church, which always manages to thrill me thanks to the square in front of it. The latter is full of cafes, bars and Florentine genuineness. You can't leave Florence without having tasted my favourite sandwich by Simone, the tripe place from San Frediano in piazza dei Nerli. Have a nice trip and have fun in the cradle of Italian culture!!
